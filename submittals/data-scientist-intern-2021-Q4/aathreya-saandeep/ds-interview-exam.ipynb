    "\n",
    "Consider a regression setting where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to come up with a function $f(X): \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimizes the squared-error loss $(Y - f(X))^2$. Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "EPE(f) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y-f(X)^2\\right]\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y|X=x\\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of any method is to approximate the regression function above, which we denote as $\\hat{f}(x)$. For example, linear regression explicitly assumes that the regression function is approximately linear in its arguments, i.e. $\\hat{f}(x) = x^T\\beta$ while a neural network provides a nonlinear approximation of the regression function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all these methods is [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to. In other words, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm converges to the ideal solution as both the training sample size and number of neighbors increase to infinity.\n",

  {

    "#### Solution\n",
    "The above mentioned universal approximator has a strong theoretical foundation which makes implicit assumptions regarding training size $N$ and the dimensionality $p$. Practical implementation of these assumptions are not feasible as the problem being solved gets more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is conditioned on a region and therefore, the output is always constant over that region. This leads to the fact that as $k$ grows in size, the algorithm becomes more stables. More specifically, as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $k \\rightarrow \\infty, \\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{E}[Y|X=x]$. In the real world, $N$ never reaches infinity and subsequently, $k$ cannot reach infinity. Coming up with large dataset for a complex problem (e.g. Video segmentation) is a infeasible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as the dimension $p$ of the input grows in size, the data tends to be highly sparse. The notion that the points are geometrically close to each other belongs to the same probability distribution becomes invalid. Accordingly, the neighbors of a particular data point will be farther as compared to the lower dimensional counterpart. In this sense, the volume covered by the $k$ neighbors becomes very large to the extent that a small $k$ tend to cover the entire data space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The globally linear nature of linear regression functions and the additive modelling of these functions are another example of unrealistic assumptions that are used to tackle the dimensionality curse. Neural networks in general are shown to be universal approximator of any functions. It resolves the linearity assumption by including non-linear functionalities in its modelling such as sigmoid. Moreover, NNs have been shown to be successful in identifying low dimensional features that are generally not apparent in high dimensional space. \n"
